# Razorpay Clone

## Introduction
Hi, I've created a clone website of Razorpay using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. This project aims to replicate the user interface and design of the original Razorpay website.

## Features
- Navigation bar: The website includes a responsive navigation bar with a logo and links to different sections of the page.
- Hero section: The hero section showcases a brief introduction and a call-to-action button to hire me.
- Project section: This section displays a list of projects, each with its own details, including project name, description, and links to GitHub and live demo.
- Skills section: The skills section highlights my technical skills and provides information about my experience and expertise.
- Contact Me section: This section allows visitors to get in touch with me by filling out a contact form.
- Footer: The footer contains links to different sections of the website and links to my social media profiles.

## Technologies Used
The Razorpay clone website is built using the following technologies:
- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages and customizing the appearance.
- Tailwind CSS: Used as a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building responsive designs.

## Usage
To use the Razorpay clone website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can navigate through different sections using the navigation bar or by scrolling through the page.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the original design and concept of Razorpay, which served as inspiration for this clone project.

Please note that this is a clone website created for educational purposes and does not provide any real Razorpay functionality or services.

Feel free to explore the website and get in touch with me if you have any questions or feedback.

Thank you!
Amanjot Singh
